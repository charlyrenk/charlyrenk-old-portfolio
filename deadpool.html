    <p class="homeParagraph">
        At Periscope Ad Agency, I was assigned has the primary developer for a microsite that featured a new gummy candy from Trolli.
        Stemming from a cooperative ad campaign between Ferrara (Trolli's parent company) and Fox, Trolli designed a Deadpool themed gummy snacks while also promoting 
        the Deadpool 2 Theatrical and Blu-ray releases.
        <br>
        I was in charge of building out three phases of the site, all of which incorporated slightly different designs and assets. I worked with designers and creatives to create a humorous, yet 
        stylized web experience that shined light on both Deadpool and his mouth-watering candies.

        *Keep in mind there a few easter eggs hidden on each phase of the site. Maybe the meta data would be a good place to start... ;-)
