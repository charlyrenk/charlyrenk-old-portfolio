                Belwin Conservancy, an outdoor science program that teaches
                phenology to over 10,000 students a year, wanted an application for their
                students to gather on-site data while exploring the vast acres of Belwinâ€™s
                wildlife property. <br>
                <br>
                Working on a team with four other software developers, we created a
                dynamic information gathering application that works offline for students
                until they reach wifi connection. Once connected students submit their
                gathered data to a collective database for teachers/ admins to then
                utilize. <br>
                <br>
                Tech used: SQL, Express, AngularJS, Node, Postgres, Angular Material,
                PassportJS.
